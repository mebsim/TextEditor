# TextEditor

This is more of a trial at making a Text Editor. It probably could be more efficent. It porbably could be better porgrammed. It could be a lot of things. But it is what it is. I split it up so I sort of understand the basis of it.

It uses LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) in order to use OpenGL and Slick2D to deal with the fonts.

All files made with it are .noted files. I will change the name later.

BEWARE: open it in terminal or a IDE, don't have a file searching GUI (working on it right now).
